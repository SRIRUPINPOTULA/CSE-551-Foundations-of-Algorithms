Question: 

We have 7 medical images for normal cells and tumor cells. Given the similarity matrix of images as below. Can you cluster these cells into two categories in O(nlogn) time.
distance_matrix = [ [0, 38, 17, 28, 88, 59, 13], [38, 0, 52, 49, 83, 91, 59], [17, 52, 0, 46, 34, 77, 80], [28, 49, 46, 0, 5, 53, 62], [88, 83, 34, 5, 0, 43, 33], [59, 91, 77, 53, 43, 0, 27], [13, 59, 80, 62, 33, 27, 0] ] \
